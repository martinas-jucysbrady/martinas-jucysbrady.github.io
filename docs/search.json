    "text": "0. Executive Summary\nThis report analyses Siemens Healthineers’ strategic position in the global medical technology industry and proposes actions Siemens can take to strengthen its long term competitiveness. First, the diagnostics examines the external environment using PESTEL, Porter’s Five Forces, Porter’s Value Chain and a VRIO framework.\nThis analysis highlights ageing populations, rising chronic disease, labour shortages and cost pressures as key demand drivers, while strict EU regulations raise compliance and complexity but also create high barriers to entry. Environmental and social pressures, which encompass circular designs and carbon footprints, further exemplify expectations around sustainability and ethical business practices.\nThe internal environment of Siemens benefits from advanced Al enabled technology and platforms, which allow Siemens to possess valuable and hard-to-recreate capabilities. Porter’s Value Chain specifically shows that heavy investment in developing the business drives high costs but underpins differentiation and recurring revenue.\nBuilding on diagnostics, the intervention stage evaluates Siemens’ current focus on digital transformation as well aligned with sector trends, but exposes the vulnerabilities associated with this, such as over commitment to only slightly improving existing products and the demanding complexity of coordination on a global level. A Blue Ocean inspired strategy to the shift allows for the dominance in the less contested markets of modular diagnostics. Turning regulations into an advantage by embedding an “ethical-by-design” framework that goes beyond solely compliance, but builds trust, transparency and ethically will by a key differentiator. The intervention also calls for deeper integration of sustainability targets by using digital tools such as predictive analytics to enhance supply chain visibility to align with these decarbonisation goals.\nThe evaluation section assesses these recommendations across four themes: the expansion of products and services, the integration of sustainable practices, the strengthening of business ethics, and building partnerships. Siemens is well equipped to produce scalable modular diagnostic tools, and adapt these across different markets, which improves worldwide healthcare access and financial growth.\nEmbedding sustainability into all aspects of the supply chain is feasible, likely to yield operational resilience and improve reputation. Strengthening ethical governance of AI, by using ethical-by-design principles, is key to maintaining regulatory compliance and securing the trust of long term patients, providers and regulators. The evaluation concludes that leveraging existing partnerships, with hospitals and governments alike, is essential executing these strategies, opening new markets and solidifying its role as a leader in sustainable and digitalised healthcare."

    "text": "1. Overview & Orientation\nSiemens Healthineers is a leading global medical-technology company specialising in diagnostic imaging and advanced therapy systems. The company enables hospitals and laboratories to diagnose and treat disease more efficiently, generating value through the sale of high-end equipment, software platforms, and long-term maintenance and upgrade contracts.\nStrategically, Siemens Healthineers competes through technological leadership, systems integration, and partnership-based business models, underpinned by heavy R&D investment and advanced in-house manufacturing. Its operating environment is shaped by rapid technological change, regulatory pressure, and shifting healthcare delivery models. To remain competitive, the company has had to develop capabilities that differentiate it in terms of clinical performance, reliability and integrated solutions.\nThis report addresses the following key strategic issues: 1. Leveraging Al and digital capabilities while managing regulatory and ethical risks 2. Aligning sustainability and decarbonisation goals with cost structures and growth in emerging markets 3. Improving multinational coordination across R&D, manufacturing and services 4. Positioning current strategies to capture long-term value from workforce shortages and the shift to value-based healthcare.\nThe remainder of this report addresses these issues through three stages. The diagnostic stage develops a detailed external and internal analysis using PESTEL, Five Forces, VRIO, and value-chain perspectives. The intervention stage investigates Siemens Healthineers’ current strategy and explores options such as Blue Ocean moves, ethical-by-design Al governance and sustainability driven innovation. Finally, the evaluation stage assesses how effectively these strategic directions support sustainable growth, ethical leadership and expanded global healthcare access, while also providing recommendations for Siemens Healthineers’ future strategic positioning."

    "text": "2. Literature Review\nContemporary healthcare literature highlights numerous demographic, technological, regulatory and strategic forces reshaping the global med-tech market. Ageing populations across OECD and EU economies are significantly increasing demand for diagnostics, imaging and chronic disease management ((OECD 2024); (European Commission, Eurostat 2025)). At the same time, persistent healthcare workforce shortages are accelerating the shift towards digital and AI-enabled diagnostic solutions ((Eurofound 2024); (Deloitte 2024)). Economically, while global healthcare spending continues to increase, manufacturers are facing sustained cost pressures and value-based procurement requirements that prioritise efficiency and measurable outcomes ((KPMG 2024)).\nStrategically, digital transformation is widely recognised as a core driver of competitive advantage in healthcare organisations ((Teece et al. 2025)). Sustainability research further emphasises the growing relevance of circular-economy principles in medical-device design and supply chains ((Hoveling et al. 2024)). Altogether, this literature establishes the external pressures and strategic imperatives shaping value creation in Siemens Healthineers’ operating environment."

    "section": "3. Diagnostic",
    "text": "3. Diagnostic\n\n3.1 PESTEL Analysis\nThe environment in which Siemens Healthineers operates is shaped by international policy priorities focused on digital transformation, patient safety, and ethical innovation. The EU’s ageing population continues to grow, increasing demand for chronic-disease management and long-term investment in preventive and diagnostic technologies ((OECD 2024)). At a regulatory level, the EU Medical Device Regulation and In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation impose strict safety, certification, and traceability standards, raising compliance complexity and barriers to entry ((European Medicines Agency 2017)). In addition, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act classifies medical AI as “high risk,” requiring transparency and human oversight in diagnostic applications ((European Parliament and Council 2024)). Overall, this political environment both supports digital-health expansion and constrains firms through heightened regulation, making policy navigation a key source of competitive advantage.\nRising healthcare demand, cost pressures, and shifting investment conditions are shaping the economic environment surrounding Siemens Healthineers. Global healthcare spending accounted for 9.9% of world GDP in 2022 ((World Health Organization 2024)), though fiscal tightening and higher debt-servicing costs may limit future growth. Inflationary pressures, particularly in energy and semiconductor manufacturing, have increased production and logistics costs ((Deloitte 2024)). Despite this, the med-tech sector remains attractive, with KPMG forecasting around 5% annual global growth in medical-device demand to 2030, driven by ageing populations and chronic-disease prevalence.\nDemographic and social trends are significantly reshaping healthcare demand. Across OECD countries, 18.51% of the population was aged 65 or over in 2024, a figure projected to rise to 27% by 2050 ((OECD 2024)). The EU’s median age reached 44.7 years in 2024 ((European Commission, Eurostat 2025)). Ageing populations are closely linked to rising chronic and degenerative disease, increasing demand for diagnostic and imaging solutions. At the same time, healthcare and long-term care face severe labour shortages ((Eurofound 2024)), accelerating the adoption of AI-driven and digitally enabled diagnostic technologies ((Deloitte 2024)).\nTechnological innovation is a core driver of Siemens Healthineers’ competitiveness. The healthcare sector is undergoing rapid digital transformation, with Al playing a central role in improving efficiency and diagnostic precision ((Deloitte 2024)). Siemens’ platforms, including AI-Rad Companion and Syngo Carbon, are designed to reduce clinician workload and enhance clinical accuracy ((Siemens Healthineers 2024)). Established firms such as Siemens Healthineers hold a strong advantage over startups due to their deep integration within healthcare systems and superior access to large-scale datasets ((KPMG 2024)). In the context of global healthcare-worker shortages, labour-saving technologies are increasingly essential, presenting a significant growth opportunity for the company.\nEnvironmental sustainability has become a major priority within the med-tech sector. Healthcare organisations are increasingly recognised as significant contributors to global emissions, prompting pressure to decarbonise both operations and supply chains ((Deloitte 2024)). Circular-design strategies, including reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling, are becoming central to reducing environmental impact ((Hoveling et al. 2024)). With the EU Circular Economy Act expected in 2026, sustainability considerations will become even more important in medical-device manufacturing.\nWithin a complex and evolving legal landscape, Siemens Healthineers must comply with strict frameworks governing both data protection and the ethical use of artificial intelligence. The EU MDR 2017/745 and IVDR 2017/746 require rigorous conformity assessments and certification for all medical devices. Data governance is equally critical, with the European Data Act (2023/2854) and the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (2024) introducing harmonised rules to protect patient privacy, ensure fair data usage, and support trustworthy AI deployment in healthcare.\n\n\n3.2 Porter’s Five Forces\nThreat of new entrants\nBarriers to entry in the European medical-technology sector are high due to heavy regulation, major capital requirements, and extensive R&D needs ((MMSL 2014)). Siemens’ advanced imaging, diagnostics, and therapy systems require complex manufacturing, regulatory approvals, and established distribution, making entry difficult. Strong brand recognition and long-standing hospital relationships further raise barriers. However, software- and AI-focused start-ups in digital health may gradually lower entry barriers (EIT, 2025).\nSupplier bargaining power\nSuppliers in the healthcare-technology industry include component manufacturers, software providers, consumables producers, and contract manufacturers. Siemens global scale and diversified operations give it strong purchasing power, which weakens overall supplier power. While medical-device components can be specialised, firms can often switch suppliers and consolidate purchases to limit supplier influence ((MMSL 2014)). For Siemens, proprietary components such as MRI magnets and PET/CT detectors give some specialised suppliers modest power due to limited alternatives. However, Siemens’ size, global sourcing network, and vertical integration significantly reduce this risk. The growing role of Al may increase reliance on software and data suppliers, potentially raising supplier power over time.\nBuyer Power\nBuyers in this industry are large organisations such as hospitals and laboratories, giving them strong bargaining power. They purchase high-value equipment like imaging systems and negotiate aggressively on pricing, servicing, maintenance, leasing, and upgrades ((Lethbridge 2011)). As a result, buyer power is significant for Siemens. However, Siemens’ strong brand reputation and reliability help preserve some negotiating power. Trust is critical for high-cost medical equipment, and long-standing positive relationships allow Siemens to maintain pricing within reasonable limits, as many buyers prioritise proven performance and service continuity.\nThreat of substitutes\nIn the healthcare-technology sector, substitutes include alternative diagnostic methods, outsourced lab services, and digital diagnostics that may reduce reliance on traditional imaging and laboratory systems. Although regulation and clinical requirements limit rapid substitution, the threat remains as technology and competition continue to evolve ((MMSL 2014)). For Siemens, portable imaging and ultrasound can substitute for some CT/MRI use cases, while outsourcing and AI-based diagnostics may reduce hardware demand. However, the high capital cost and technical complexity of Siemens’ advanced systems limit large-scale substitution. Siemens is also investing in AI through partnerships and acquisitions to turn this threat into a strategic opportunity (ARC, 2025).\nCompetitive Rivalry\nCompetition in the medical-technology sector is intense, with major rivals such as General Electric and Philips Healthcare, alongside over 25,000 medical-device firms in Europe, many of which are SMEs ((MMSL 2014)). These firms compete with powerful incumbents holding large market shares, making rivalry strong despite Siemens’ leading position. Rivalry is further intensified by moderate market growth and significant price pressure, with customers demanding both value and advanced service. Differentiation is increasingly based on technology and innovation rather than price alone. Siemens’ acquisition of Varian Medical Systems highlights the ongoing competition for scale and market share ((Subiris 2024)).\n\n\n3.3 VRIO Analysis\nSiemens Healthineers possesses technological and organisational resources that give it a strong competitive advantage in the global med-tech industry. Its advanced AI-enabled diagnostic and imaging platforms, including the Syngo Carbon IT system, deliver significant value by improving efficiency and supporting value-based healthcare models, a trend accelerated by pandemic-era digitalisation ((Siemens Healthineers AG 2024)). As one of the world’s largest medical-technology companies, Siemens Healthineers has capabilities and scale that most competitors cannot easily replicate.\nThese strengths, combined with its embedded relationships with hospitals and health authorities worldwide, contribute to a high level of inimitability. Partnerships such as those with the Ministry of Health in Murcia, Spain, and other major health systems globally, are difficult for smaller firms to access or reproduce ((Siemens Healthineers AG 2024)). Siemens Healthineers is structured to fully capture this value. Its Value Partnerships framework formalises co-creation with providers and uses clearly defined KPIs and performance-based incentives to drive innovation ((Siemens Healthineers 2024)). Additional strengths, including Operational Excellence programmes, diagnostic-laboratory automation, and a strong presence in public-private partnerships, reinforce a culture focused on long-term efficiency and transformation.\nOverall, the combination of AI innovation, strategic partnerships, and operational capability underpins Siemens Healthineers’ sustained competitive advantage over most other med-tech firms.\n\n\n3.4 Porter’s Value Chain Model\nPorter’s Value Chain Model is a model that analyses a company’s internal operations by looking into its activities to see where value is created and where costs occur. The model divides activities into two categories of basic activities and auxiliary activities. Cost control and the determination of competitive advantages can be carried out at every level of the process ((Ruan 2020)). In the context of Siemens Healthineers, applying this value chain model allows for the analysis of 5 aspects of the business that are inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales and service. All these aspects play a key role in value creation and must be considered also in relation to cost structure. Auxiliary activities such as the development of technologies used to aid the business, HR and infrastructure development must also be evaluated in order to identify internal strengths and possible areas for improvement.\nInsights gained from Value Chain Model\nApplying Porter’s Value Chain to Siemens Healthineers allows for a clear insight into the creation of value and the occurrence of costs within the business. Inbound logistics are a key aspect of Siemens business as they rely on expensive and high tech components to be shipped in to produce their products and operate their machinery. High costs arise here from global shipping of materials inwards however their high quality and differentiated products allow them to create value in a competitive industry. Siemens invests heavily in their operations every year specifically in R&D. 900 million dollars annually is spent in the US by Siemens on R&D which shows their commitment to manufacturing new and advanced products ((Siemens Healthineers AG 2024)). This bears a significant cost but in order to gain a competitive edge in the pharmaceutical industry it is necessary.\nOutbound logistics and installation of machinery is a complex aspect of Siemens business as it is a global process which incurs significant costs but also is a key strength of Siemens as they are recognised as a global brand with customers worldwide. Recurring sales and contracts are a common theme in the Pharmaceutical industry which is a major part of Siemens revenue. They place significant emphasis on marketing and partnerships to increase customer loyalty and create value for their client base. Their service activity is a major value creator for their business by maintaining and upgrading their products consistently. This not only is cost heavy but also requires significant infrastructure to carry out their service activity. Auxiliary activities such as HR, technological development and procurement cement their competitive advantage but also add significant overheads. This pattern throughout the various aspects of their business shows the strategic trade-off between investing heavily versus lean cost-oriented operations. The nature of Siemens Healthineers business requires heavy investment but draws significant gains."

    "title": "Siemens Healthineers Strategic Consultancy Report",
    "section": "4. Strategic Intervention",
    "text": "4. Strategic Intervention\nThe current strategy deployed by Siemens Healthineers is centred on technological leadership, with significant investment in digital transformation and AI. This aligns with global healthcare trends, as multinational firms increasingly view digitalisation as the future of healthcare delivery ((Imperial Executive Education 2025)). Siemens Healthineers aims to lead the digital transformation of the industry while advancing remote healthcare solutions ((Siemens Healthineers, n.d.)). With ageing populations and chronic illness representing major global health challenges, this strategy remains well aligned with the contemporary healthcare environment. As one of Europe’s leading healthcare companies, Siemens Healthineers benefits from substantial global trust and recognition, supporting its proactive strategic direction.\nA resource-based view defines competitive advantage through a firm’s internal resources and capabilities ((Mazzei 2024)). Siemens Healthineers possesses advanced digital technologies, strong R&D infrastructure and highly specialised machinery, all of which contribute to a sustainable competitive advantage. These technological resources enable the firm to meet the evolving needs of the healthcare industry while strengthening customer goodwill and trust ((IP Business Academy 2025)). From a VRIO perspective, these assets are valuable, rare and difficult to imitate, reinforcing Siemens Healthineers’ long-term market strength. A Blue Ocean strategy offers a suitable response by enabling Siemens Healthineers to diversify, reduce risk and establish leadership in uncontested market spaces.\nA Blue Ocean strategy is defined as one that expands industry boundaries and operates beyond existing competition, rendering rivals irrelevant ((MyPOS 2025)). One viable direction would be to shift from post-diagnosis treatment towards pre-diagnosis monitoring. By utilising existing AI-monitoring capabilities to detect early signs of disease, Siemens could move upstream in the healthcare value chain. While companies such as Huma and AliveCor operate in this space, they lack the scale, R&D capacity and financial resources of Siemens Healthineers, positioning the firm well for market dominance.\nA second Blue Ocean opportunity lies within global emerging markets. Siemens Healthineers already supports diagnostic access in regions such as Africa through initiatives like the Africa Medical Equipment Facility, which provides affordable cancer care ((IFC 2023)). As more economies emerge globally, Siemens Healthineers has the opportunity to collaborate with governments and become a foundational healthcare partner in fast-growing regions, strengthening both market reach and social impact.\nThe firm’s expanding reliance on medical AI introduces both opportunity and accountability. Under the EU Artificial Intelligence Act, medical AI systems are classified as “high-risk”, subjecting Siemens Healthineers to heightened regulatory scrutiny regarding transparency, data protection and algorithmic bias ((European Parliament and Council 2024)). While the company’s strong governance infrastructure provides a solid base, genuine competitive differentiation will depend on its ability to move beyond compliance towards proactive ethical leadership.\nEthical AI leadership itself can function as a form of value innovation. By embedding ethical-by-design principles throughout AI development, Siemens Healthineers can integrate fairness, explainability and data protection from conception to deployment ((Teece et al. 2025)). This approach would transform regulation into a strategic advantage and foster trust-based markets in which safety, integrity and accountability become key differentiators. In an increasingly data-driven healthcare ecosystem, ethical legitimacy is likely to attract partnerships with governments, hospitals and organisations prioritising responsible innovation.\nThe diagnostic analysis further highlights that Siemens Healthineers operates within a highly resource-intensive and cost-sensitive environment ((Deloitte 2024)). Although its 2024 sustainability report outlines ambitious targets, including a 90 per cent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and Scope 3 emissions by 2050, progress remains uneven across geographical regions ((Siemens Healthineers 2024)). While sustainability performance is strongest in Europe, underdeveloped supply chains in emerging markets present operational and reputational challenges.\nTo close this gap, Siemens Healthineers could apply its digital and AI-driven capabilities to develop transparent, adaptive supply-chain systems. Blockchain technology and predictive analytics could enable real-time monitoring of emissions, waste and regulatory compliance across global suppliers. By aligning sustainability standards with local regulatory contexts, environmental responsibility could be transformed from a reactive cost centre into a proactive source of long-term resilience and value creation.\nDespite recognising ageing populations and rising chronic disease as key demand drivers, Siemens Healthineers’ sustainability strategy remains only partially integrated with healthcare access objectives. The current focus is largely on emissions and product efficiency rather than affordability and accessibility in lower-income markets. This represents a strategic opportunity gap. The firm’s VRIO position confirms that it possesses the digital infrastructure, AI expertise and partnership networks required to address global healthcare accessibility, yet these resources remain underutilised ((Teece et al. 2025)). By integrating sustainability with inclusive innovation, Siemens Healthineers could develop modular, energy-efficient diagnostic technologies tailored to infrastructure-limited healthcare systems."

    "text": "5. Evaluation\nBased on the diagnostic and intervention stages, the evaluation stage assesses how effectively Siemens Healthineers’ strategies support sustainable growth, ethical leadership and global healthcare expansion. It examines the impact of the company’s strategy across product innovation, sustainability integration, ethical governance and partnerships, highlighting the extent of how these align with Siemens’ broader goal of advancing the accessible and sustainable healthcare world.\n\n5.1 Expansion of products and services\nFrom the diagnostics stage it can be identified that Siemens already holds a competitive advantage that stems from its use of AI-enabled diagnostic and imaging platforms (such as Syngo Carbon and AI-Rad Companion, which are both deeply integrated into the international healthcare system). In the current healthcare industry, a trend of healthcare professional shortages and a growing demand for scalable, cost-effective technologies can be identified, which presents Siemens with a clear opportunity to expand its offerings and respond to global needs ((Deloitte 2024)). In line with these findings, the intervention stage highlights Siemens’ efforts to broaden diagnostic access in foreign and emerging markets. Partnerships such as the Africa Medical Equipment Facility demonstrate successful expansion, enabling affordable, modular healthcare solutions for infrastructure-limited settings ((IFC 2023)). This highlights that there is significant potential for Siemens to further deploy the Blue Ocean strategy, by collaborating with emerging governments and entering uncontested markets and deliver impactful, sustainable solutions.\nSiemens is well positioned to move beyond the use of AI just for post diagnosis treatment and develop tools with the capabilities of early detection. By developing modular and cost-efficient diagnostic products, with a focus on environmental and sustainable leadership into their core business strategy, Siemens can create a product that serves markets of developed and emerging regions. By taking inspiration from companies like Huma and AliveCor, who are pursuing such business strategies, Siemens can use their huge resource pool and leadership to provide a competitive advantage.\nGiving underserved individuals access to healthcare and sustainability will allow Siemens to speed up their development of scalable products that address global health problems and also support decarbonisation. This approach reinforces Siemens’ commitment to healthcare innovation and also encapsulates their target of long term business growth through the creation of new market opportunities and a greater social purpose.\n\n\n5.2 Integration of sustainable practises\nFrom the diagnostic stage, it is evident that the healthcare industry remains a major contributor to the global climate crisis, driving urgent calls for decarbonisation and circular economy adoption. Siemens Healthineers’ 2024 Sustainability Report sets ambitious goals, including a 90% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and a 90% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2050 ((Siemens Healthineers 2024)). However, while these targets demonstrate global leadership in sustainability, they are not yet fully synchronised across all operational regions, pointing to an opportunity for deeper integration of sustainability frameworks into the company’s diagnostic and intervention strategies.\nIn response to growing regulatory requirements such as the EU Circular Economy Act, Siemens can embed environmental and social considerations into every product and market strategy. Developing modular, energy-efficient diagnostic tools and transforming supply chains through blockchain and predictive analytics will allow Siemens to track emissions and waste across product lifecycles, aligning sustainability with transparency and compliance. This approach would not only enhance operational resilience but also generate long-term value through sustained innovation and trust.\nBy positioning itself as a pioneer in sustainable healthcare, Siemens can enter new eco-conscious markets where sustainability itself becomes a differentiating factor. Integrating sustainability as a core business driver reinforces Siemens’ social purpose, strengthens brand reputation and delivers a competitive advantage by aligning business performance with global health and environmental goals.\n\n\n5.3 Strengthen business ethics\nFrom the diagnostic analysis, Siemens Healthineers operates under an increasingly complex regulatory environment, particularly concerning data protection, patient safety, and the ethical deployment of artificial intelligence. Frameworks such as the EU Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) 2017/745 and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation (IVDR) 2017/746 mandate conformity assessments to ensure compliance and ethical use of technology ((European Medicines Agency 2017)). As AI-driven medical solutions become more prominent, Siemens faces heightened scrutiny regarding transparency, privacy, and algorithmic bias, which are challenges that position medical AI as a high-risk category under EU law.\nThe intervention phase highlights an opportunity to move beyond basic compliance towards proactive ethical innovation. By embedding an “ethical-by-design” framework in every stage of AI development ((Teece et al. 2025)), Siemens can transform regulatory demands into a catalyst for trust-based value creation. This forward-looking ethical governance can strengthen Siemens’ global reputation for safety, integrity, and accountability. In a data-driven healthcare landscape, such ethical leadership not only builds worldwide trust but also serves as a powerful source of competitive advantage.\n\n\n5.4 Build partnerships\nThe diagnostic stage shows that Siemens Healthineers has already established a wide-reaching network of partnerships with hospitals and healthcare ministries across the globe. Through its Value Partnerships framework, Siemens collaborates with institutions such as the Ministry of Health in Murcia, Spain, and with emerging market governments under initiatives like the Africa Medical Equipment Facility ((IFC 2023)). These embedded relationships form an inimitable part of Siemens’ operational advantage, enabling continuous innovation and effective value capture across markets.\nAt the intervention stage, Siemens has the opportunity to further expand this network through strategic collaborations that prioritise responsible innovation and align with the Blue Ocean strategy. By co-developing scalable healthcare infrastructure solutions and entering untapped regions, Siemens can strengthen its position as a transformative partner in global healthcare. These efforts would not only reinforce the company’s competitive edge but also accelerate long-term industry transformation by breaking barriers to healthcare access and driving sustainable growth across international markets."

    "text": "6. Consulting Process Reflection\nBecoming strategic consultants required us to really think critically. We had to act as if we were a real world consultancy firm approaching Siemens Healthineers. To achieve this, we made use of the knowledge we had gained from attending lectures and engaging with the course material by integrating frameworks such as PESTEL, VRIO, and Porter’s Five Forces into our strategic narrative. Through extensive research and application of these frameworks we gained meaningful insights into Siemens Healthineers’ strategy and the medical technology industry as a whole.\nDuring the diagnostic stage we applied the aforementioned frameworks to collect and analyse key information and data relating to Siemens Healthineers. We investigated and took insights from industry reports and literature. This allowed us to get a sense of the market environment and where our client is positioned within it. Focusing on what gives Siemens a strategic advantage and where it is falling behind in relation to its competitors. These insights that we gained here directly informed the direction of our strategic recommendations which followed the diagnostic stage.\nThe intervention stage represented clear progression from our diagnostic analysis, as we moved from identifying strategic issues to proposing realistic, evidence-based solutions for Siemen’s Healthineers. Building on insights gained from the frameworks above, we were able to justify our recommendations with greater confidence and strategic coherence. This transition highlighted the importance of ensuring interventions were firmly rooted in prior analysis rather than basing off assumption. We also became more aware of the need to balance creativity with feasibility when proposing strategic change. Presenting these interventions in an accessible way through the presentation and report was particularly valuable, as it required us to communicate complex strategic ideas clearly for an audience. Overall, this stage strengthened our understanding of how effective consultancy moves systematically from diagnosis of both opportunities and threats to action."
