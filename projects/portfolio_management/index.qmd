In this project, I created an investment portfolio using the Markowitz Portfolio Optimization model. The goal was to maximize returns while minimizing risk by selecting a diversified mix of assets. I analyzed historical data, calculated expected returns and covariances, and used optimization techniques to determine the optimal asset allocation. The resulting portfolio was designed to achieve a balance between risk and return, providing a solid foundation for long-term investment success.
